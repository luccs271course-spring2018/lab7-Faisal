1. Why does `LinkedStack` not require an explicit constructor?
    - The reason it does not require an explicit constructor is because it uses an implicit constructor.
2. What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the `LinkedStack` methods, as well as `ReverseLines.main`?
    - The Time complexity should be the same (that is O(1).)
    - Since all insertions and deletions are done at one end.
    - For the LinkedStack, it uses almost exactly as much space as needed.
    - However, extra storage is needed for the links in LinkedStack.
    - ReversedLines.main should have the same time complexity.
3. How else (not using `Node`) could we have implemented `LinkedStack` in such a way that it is still based on a linked list but the `asList` method uses constant time and space?
    - We could have implemented LinkedStack using an object on any class that implements the List interface (simplest being ArrayList).
    - Since time and space (almost) are going to be constant.
4. Is it better for `push` and `pop` to return the item or the stack itself?
    Briefly discuss the pros and cons of each design.
    - It depends on the design of your program. If you need to inspect and use each element that it should return the item. If you want to return the entire stack then you can push or pop the entire stack, although that may not be very efficient.
